If you're simply interested in playing the game, check out this [Release Page](https://www.youtube.com/). If you're curious about how the game was made, the code for the game is public with a project setup guide below.

## About the Project and Developer

What started out as a quick summer project to experiment with [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) turned into a quirky arcade game that I became proud of. The basic gameplay and UI functionality was created first and the storyline and theme followed. The goal of this project was not to make a full game engine or even to utilize game software design patterns, but to simply see what it took to make a game with C++. In the process of working on this project, I learned much about graphics programming, organizing game logic and UI logic, and working on larger projects in general.

The code isn't perfect, and there are many things I would have designed better in retrospect. The code in "core.cpp" certainly turned more messy than intended due to additions I added on after designing the initial game. Still, I chose to make this a project with personality with a tradeoff of messier design. The goal is to apply what I learned from mistakes made in this project to future projects.

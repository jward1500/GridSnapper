# Grid Snapper

Test out your muscle memory with this speedrunning-focused arcade game. Practice the levels to improve your time and fight against <strong>Snap</strong> and <strong>Croc</strong> to get on the leaderboard.

What started out as a short and sweet summer project experimenting with [SDL 3.0](https://www.libsdl.org/) turned into a fun and quirky arcade game that I became proud of. This project stretched my ability to design game logic and keep code organized as the project grew larger. If you're simply interested in playing the game, check out this [Release Page](https://www.youtube.com/) If you're curious about how the game was made, the code for the game is public with a project setup guide below.
